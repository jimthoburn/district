## Parent Roundtable

The Superintendent meets quarterly with the Parent Roundtable. The Roundtable is  a group of parents representing schools throughout the District. It advises the Superintendent on issues and concerns facing the District.

## Message from the Superintendent

The single most important factor in ensuring a child’s success in school is the presence of an outstanding teacher in the classroom, and the School Board and I believe that Azusa Unified teachers are some of the very best in California. 

Earlier this year, labor contract negotiations between AUSD and the Azusa Educators Association (AEA), the bargaining unit for our teachers, stalled and entered what’s known as “impasse,” which means that one party to the negotiations believed that the two sides were so far from agreement that further negotiation was pointless.

I am very pleased to report that the AEA and the school district have agreed that resuming good-faith discussion is best for everyone involved, especially our students.

Going forward, we will continue to show all our employees the respect they deserve for their outstanding commitment to the success of the students we serve.

Dr. Linda Kaminski
