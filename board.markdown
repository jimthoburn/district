# Board of Education

The five-member Board of Education is a policy-making body which governs the District’s educational program. It acts under the authority of the State Constitution, the Education Code and the California State Board of Education. Elected at large for four-year terms, members must be qualified electors residing within the boundaries of the school district. Elections are held each odd-numbered year.

## Get involved

We encourage you to attend our meetings, all of which are open to the public. Certain matters regarding personnel, student matters and collective bargaining issues will be discussed in closed session, as required by Government Code. The Board will not discuss complaints against individual employees in an open meeting. Board meetings are an excellent way to learn about District programs.

Your attendance at Board meetings is an excellent way of becoming better informed about our schools. The Board usually meets the first and third Tuesday of each month in the Board Room of the Administration Center, located at 546 South Citrus Avenue in Azusa. Meetings begin with a closed session or an open work study session. Regular agenda items are considered at 7:00 p.m.
