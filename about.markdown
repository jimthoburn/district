# About Our District

Azusa Unified is a district that believes its children deserve the best education possible.  Approximately 9,659 students attend Azusa Unified schools which include eleven elementary, three middle and three high schools, as well as an Alternative Education Center.

AUSD is dedicated to academic success for all students. The student centered program emphasizes a standards-based curriculum, enrichment classes and a commitment to educational technology.  The District also offers a Gifted and Talented Education program, special programs for at-risk students and an extensive special education program.

AUSD continues to strengthen the instructional program for students so they are prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Azusa Unified has high expectations for students.  In addition to the basic skills, great attention is given to advanced courses, electives and vocational classes.  The emphasis is on academic achievement and there’s a system for monitoring student performance that is tied to teaching objectives.

Although the District mission is universal for all, each of our schools is unique.  As long as space is available, students may attend any school in our District.  Selecting a school is a difficult choice for parents.  Please take advantage of and accept our invitation to visit our schools and meet staff.  We are extremely proud of our schools and our community.

## Community Partnerships

Students benefit from partnerships with local colleges, businesses and government entities. AUSD offers many opportunities for parent participation in PTA, Parent Boosters and the Superintendent’s Parent Roundtable. Programs such as CHAMPS encourage elementary students to start thinking about college while at the elementary school level.

## Adult Education

With lifelong learning in mind, the Azusa Adult School offers a wide array of business, computer and vocational courses.  Residents are encouraged to select from a variety of classes designed to meet their needs.
